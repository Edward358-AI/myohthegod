*TOP SECRET, ONLY SHARE THIS LINK WITH YOURSELF, DO NOT LET IT BE LEAKED OUT*

secret bypasses:

** NOTE: for the following two bypasses, you will need to redo each time u log out.

killcurly:
visit chrome://settings/signOut
visit chrome://restart
don't click anything, if there is pop up window, x out of it
visit tinyurl.com/addsession
add school/home account
you're done!


alternatively:
visit chrome://extensions (after you completed steps above)
click on an extension you want to kill, click details
at the url bar, you should see something like "?id=something"
copy the part right after the "?id=", type the following in:
chrome-extension://[EXTENSION ID YOU COPIED]/manifest.json
it should be a bunch of random JSON text. go to url bar and type "chrome://kill"
and you're done! the extension should be killed


bookmarklet bypass:
basically for chrome v106+
Requires:
1. bookmarklets
2. at least 1 extension installed from the chrome web store

Steps:
1. go to chrome://extensions
2. click any extension that's installed from the webstore, not one of the enterprise installed extensions
3. scroll down and click "Open in Chrome Web Store"
4. spam escape before the page loads. it should be a white screen. if it loads into the chrome webstore you have to try again
5. run this bookmarklet:
javascript:let shim = false;var ids = prompt("extension ids (comma separated)").split(",");setInterval(()=>{ids.forEach((id)=> opener.chrome.developerPrivate.updateExtensionConfiguration({extensionId: id, fileAccess: shim}));shim = !shim;}, 250);
7. insert extension ids. i don't feel like explaining how to get them and really you should know by now

if you close the tab the extensions come back


How to unblock get a free unblocked proxy link:
get a github account (i wont explain how that is done)
go to gitpod.io
click login near top right
click login with github
click new workspace
now, in the bar that pops up, paste either of two links:
https://github.com/Edward358-AI/myohtheweb OR https://github.com/Edward358-AI/bioluminesence

wait for workspace to load
wait for everything else in the workspace to load
make sure you see the terminal at bottom of screen, then:

since the port the proxy is running at (this is configurable, in the index.mjs file) is port 3030, type "3030-" before the crazy url you have in the url bar right now, and your url should now look something like this: 
https://3030-somefancyurl-l8bcowuh2mx.ws-us79.gitpod.io (do not actually try this)

go to that link you created, and now you are done! you have a working proxy link that is specific to you! have fun surfing!

note that it will not stay up forever, you probably will have to rerun it every once in a while
